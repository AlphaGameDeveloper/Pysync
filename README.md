# Pysync
A colour management tool

Pysync uses colours generated by Pycolor to create a bash script to sync colours between pieces of software. It pulls software and their various attributes from a file named `themes.py` located in the same directory as the main script (`~/.config/colours`). This is also where you need to run the program from.

# Install
Download the scripts, and move them to you colours directory or clone them with:

`git clone https://github.com/asexylordrevan/pysync`

Note that if you installed Pycolor before, you'll need to remove the folder first, as Pysync covers Pycolor aswell.

For easy access to the sync script, add an alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, such as ; `sync="bash ~/.config/colours/sync.sh"`.

# Configuring
Pieces of software are stored as dictionaries, under the format
`{name, location, format}`.
Just add the relevant information for each piece of software. The default configuration supports Waybar, Hyprland, Rofi and wlogout.
